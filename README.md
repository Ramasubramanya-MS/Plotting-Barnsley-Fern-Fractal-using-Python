The Barnsley fern is a fractal named after the British mathematician Michael Barnsley who first described it in his book Fractals Everywhere. He made it to resemble the black spleenwort, Asplenium adiantum-nigrum. *

Barnsley shows the IFS code for his Black Spleenwort fern fractal as a matrix of values shown in a table. In the table, the columns "a" through "f" are the coefficients of the equation, and "p" represents the probability factor. *
